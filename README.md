# GreenSentinel: Automated Garden Simulation

## Overview
GreenSentinel is an automated garden simulation system designed to streamline garden maintenance tasks. Built with object-oriented design principles, this project automates routine tasks such as watering, environmental monitoring, and pest control. It features a user-friendly JavaFX interface for real-time control and robust logging through Log4j for effective troubleshooting and system monitoring.

## Features
- **Automated Watering:** Schedule and automate watering based on environmental conditions.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Track key parameters like temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.
- **Pest Control Simulation:** Implement pest control strategies to maintain garden health.
- **Interactive Interface:** A JavaFX-driven dashboard for real-time monitoring and control.
- **Robust Logging:** Integrated Log4j for detailed logging and performance analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Java:** Primary programming language for backend development.
- **JavaFX:** Framework for creating the interactive user interface.
- **Log4j:** Logging framework to monitor system events and debug issues.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Ensures scalability and maintainability of the code.
